Hi! My name is Ben and I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/) and [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). My research is on grounding natural language to structured decision-making, and my approach is heavily inspired by ideas from linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy of mind/language, and semiotics.

I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/) and the Brown University [Morgan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Edwards) Fellowship.

I was also the lead organizer for the [Brown Robotics Talk Series](https://yzylmc.github.io/brown-lab-talks/) for the year of 2023.

### Research Philosophy

My research stems from the hypothesis that humans are interacting with a rich and highly structured decision process that is induced by their perception and action systems, and that **natural language is used to express information about this decision process**. In this view, understanding language is a matter of 1) modeling the human decision process using formalisms from reinforcement learning (these are often structured Markov Decision Processes), and 2) grounding language to statements about such decision processes.

I am deeply inspired by ideas in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy of mind/language, and semiotics. I track almost all the academic papers I read [here](https://www.zotero.org/benjamin-spiegel/library) and all the books I read [here](https://speeg.notion.site/5de77c8575634b90b4699d0f185295cb?v=a884d376bf6b4e5a99a27e9aa2e98698&pvs=4). Feel free to reach out and ask about anything in my library!

### Personal Interests

I enjoy reading, watching movies, playing ultimate frisbee, surfing, bouldering, going to the gym, playing piano, listening to music (I'm a bit of an audiophile), playing pool, and solving Rubik's Cubes (my personal best for a 3-by-3 is 9.58s, and my best Ao5 was ~12s). In recent times I was a frequent reader of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ([here's my profile](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel) if you're curious), an avid listener of the [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast/making-sense-episodes/) podcast, and did mindfulness meditation.
