Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a first-year PhD student at Brown in Computer Science advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/). I also graduated Brown University in 2022 with an ScB in [Computers and Minds](/files/ic-proposal.pdf). I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/).

### Research Philosophy

My research focus stems from a single hypothesis: language is central to intelligence and the way to solve language understanding is to _ground it_. I think the best way to do this is to _ground language to structured decision-processes_, like the ones used in Reinforcement Learning and Planning.

I believe in taking a principled approach to solving this problem that involves incorporating ideas from Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Philosophy. I expound my philosophy in [my proposal for an Independent Concentration in Computers and Minds](/files/ic-proposal.pdf).

<!-- ### Outside Interests

Outside of academics I enjoy solving Rubik's Cubes and other twisty puzzles, reading sci-fi, bouldering, playing and listening to music (I'm a bit of an audiophile, check out [my gear page](./audiogack.html)), and watching and writing comedy. I'm also a frequent reader of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ([here's my profile](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel) if you're curious), an avid listener of the [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast/making-sense-episodes/) podcast, and I do mindfullness meditation. -->
