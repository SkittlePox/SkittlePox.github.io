Hello, I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Brown University advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/), [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/), and [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). My research is on grounding natural language to structured decision-making, and my approach is heavily inspired by thinkers from a number of classical fields including linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy of mind/language, and semiotics.

I also organized the talks for the [Brown Robotics Talk Series](https://yzylmc.github.io/brown-lab-talks/) for the year of 2023.

I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/) and the Brown University [Morgan Edwards](https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=E0060) Fellowship.

### Research Philosophy

My research focus stems from the hypothesis that humans are interacting with a rich and highly structured decision process that is induced by their perception and action cognition systems, and that **natural language is used to express information about this decision process**. In this view, understanding language is a matter of 1) modeling the human decision process using formalisms from reinforcement learning (these are often structured Markov Decision Processes), and 2) grounding language to statements about decision processes.

I am deeply inspired by ideas in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy of mind/language, and semiotics. I track almost all the academic papers and books I read, the lists (and some notes) are available publicly [here](https://speeg.notion.site/speeg/Ben-s-Library-b48d1cb88e8f465baa8573a1c44b5d64/) and [here](https://www.zotero.org/benjamin-spiegel/library). Feel free to reach out and ask about anything in my library!

### Personal Interests

I enjoy [reading](https://speeg.notion.site/speeg/Ben-s-Library-b48d1cb88e8f465baa8573a1c44b5d64/), watching movies, playing ultimate frisbee, surfing, bouldering, going to the gym, playing piano, listening to music (I'm a bit of an audiophile), playing pool, and solving Rubik's Cubes (my personal best for a 3-by-3 is 9.58s, and my best Ao5 was ~12s). In recent times I was a frequent reader of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ([here's my profile](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel) if you're curious), an avid listener of the [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast/making-sense-episodes/) podcast, did mindfulness meditation.
