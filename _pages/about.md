I'm a researcher and engineer focused on creating [neurosymbolic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhymId8dr5Q) AI systems that are both interpretable and generally intelligent. I graduated Brown University with an ScB in [Computers and Minds](/assets/ic-proposal.pdf), an Independent Concentration I designed that centers on Artificial General Intelligence. I'm currently a first-year PhD student at Brown in Computer Science advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/). I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/).

### Research Philosophy

My research focus stems from a single hypothesis: language understanding is central to general intelligence. If we want to solve general AI, we need to solve language understanding, or _language grounding_. I think that the best way to do this is _to ground language to structured decision-processes_, like the ones used in Reinforcement Learning and Planning.


I believe that a highly principled approach to solving this problem involves incorporating the knowledge of the precursors to artificial intelligence: Linguistics, Psychology, and Philosophy. These fields are a major inspiration for my work, and I try to draw from them in a faithful manner. I expound my philosophy in [my proposal for an Independent Concentration in Computers and Minds](/files/ic-proposal.pdf).

### Academic Background

At Brown I've had the pleasure of working with [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/), [Ellie Pavlick](http://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/), [Michael Littman](https://www.littmania.com/), and [Stefanie Tellex](https://cs.brown.edu/people/stellex/). I've primarily worked with George and Ellie on language grounding research. Under their advisement, I completed an Honors Thesis during the '20-'21 academic year which [is available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15799). I have [some other pre-prints up as well](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F7f8xnHSmcURIaHs80LWSAUFjSzLrYf8r8EEaCHH5neiq-2v_500kQGuhYp3jFTOLrh5WkjIv6m_4PNrQDTfo6A2XVQ7Zp-owV66_eXOGXXoraLTe4&user=6t7O43MAAAAJ).

I co-created a group independent study course at Brown called Technofutures and Dystopias ([public-facing syllabus available here](https://www.notion.so/DISP-Technofutures-Dystopias-0c7ab022ab9642639b89d8fae112122c)).

### Short Work History

In the past I've worked as a Computational Linguistics Research Intern at [MeetKai](https://meetkai.com/) and as a Software Engineer Intern for [Workday](https://www.workday.com/). You can see my work history in detail on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-spiegel/).

### Outside Interests

Outside of academics I enjoy solving Rubik's Cubes and other twisty puzzles, reading sci-fi, bouldering, playing and listening to music (I'm a bit of an audiophile, check out [my gear page](./audiogack.html)), and watching and writing comedy. I'm also a frequent reader of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ([here's my profile](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel) if you're curious), an avid listener of the [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast/making-sense-episodes/) podcast, and I do mindfullness meditation.
