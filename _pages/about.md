Hi, I'm Ben. I'm a first-year PhD student at Brown in Computer Science advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/). I'm grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/).

I did my undergrad at Brown as well and graduated in 2022 with an ScB in [Computers and Minds](/files/ic-proposal.pdf). 

### Research Philosophy

My research focus stems from a single hypothesis: language is central to intelligence and the way to solve language understanding is to _ground it_. I think the best way to do this is to _ground language to structured decision-processes_, like the ones used in Reinforcement Learning and Planning.

I believe in taking a principled approach to solving this problem that involves incorporating ideas from Linguistics, Cognitive Science and Philosophy. I expound my philosophy in [my proposal](/files/ic-proposal.pdf) for an Independent Concentration in Computers and Minds.

### Personal Interests

I enjoy [reading](https://speeg.notion.site/speeg/Ben-s-Library-b48d1cb88e8f465baa8573a1c44b5d64/), watching movies, bouldering, playing and listening to music (I'm a bit of an audiophile), playing pool, and solving Rubik's Cubes (my personal best for a 3 by 3 is 9.58s). I'm also a frequent reader of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) ([here's my profile](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel) if you're curious), an avid listener of the [Making Sense](https://samharris.org/podcast/making-sense-episodes/) podcast, and I do mindfulness meditation.
