title: "RLang: A Declarative Language for Describing Partial World Knowledge to Reinforcement Learning Agents"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-08-12-rlang
excerpt: 'We introduce RLang, a domain-specific language (DSL) for communicating  domain knowledge to an RL agent. Unlike  existing RL DSLs that ground to _single_ elements of a decision-making formalism (e.g., the reward function or policy), RLang can specify information about every element of a Markov decision process. We define precise syntax and grounding semantics for RLang, and provide a parser that grounds RLang programs to an algorithm-agnostic _partial_ world model and policy that can be exploited by an RL agent. We provide a series of example RLang programs demonstrating how different RL methods can exploit the resulting knowledge, encompassing model-free and model-based tabular algorithms, policy gradient and value-based methods, hierarchical approaches, and deep methods.'
