title: "MK-SQuIT: Synthesizing Questions using Iterative Template-filling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-11-04-mk-squit
excerpt: 'The aim of this work is to create a framework for synthetically generating question/query pairs with as little human input as possible. We leverage WikiData, a knowledge base of RDF triples, as a source for generating the main content of questions and queries. Using multiple layers of question templating we are able to sidestep some of the most challenging parts of query generation that have been handled by humans in previous methods.'
